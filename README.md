# WEATHER_WEBAPP
WeatherNow is a sleek and minimal Flask-based weather app that fetches real-time data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It allows users to search for any city, view live temperature, humidity, and wind data, save favorite cities, sort them by various weather parameters, and even compare two cities — all in a clean, professional UI.
